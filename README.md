GIT: is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files

GITHUB: GitHub is an American company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git

Repository: Generically refers to a central place where data is stored and maintained. A repository can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for distribution over a network, or a repository can be a location that is directly accessible to the user without having to travel across a network. In many case, Respository is  a a database of information about the software, including data elements, processes, inputs, outputs and interrelationships.

Clone: When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.

Commit: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). 

Push: Push command pushes the commits to remote repository. 

Pull: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

Branch: A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches

Merge: Merge all of the commits into the base branch by clicking Merge pull request.

Merge Conflict: Often, merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. You must resolve all merge conflicts before you can merge a pull request on GitHub.

Fetch: se git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches. Otherwise, you can always add a new remoteand then fetch.

Remote: A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. In contrast to a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state.
